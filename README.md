## Run project

You can run the project by downloading it as .zip or cloning it with:

```
git clone https://github.com/Mate0Alvarez/worlcup_game_prediction_react.git
cd worlcup_game_prediction_react
```

Install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Luego es necesario crear un proyecto en Firebase y crear una colecci√≥n en Firestore (`games`). Para realizar una carga de partidos masiva, puede implementarse el componente `<LoadGames>`.

##### Game example:
```
game = {
        "local": "Cameroon",
        "local_score": "-",
        "local_code": "cm",
        "visitor": "Brazil",
        "visitor_score": "-",
        "visitor_code": "br",
        "final_result": "-",
        "time_stamp": "2022-12-2 16:00",
        "status": "pending",
        "date": "2022-12-02"
    }
```

The `users` collection will be created automatically when each user registers.

Once the app is available in Firebase, having loaded games, rename the `.env.example` file located at the root of the project to `.env` and fill in the Firebase-provided configuration variables:

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

Start server with:

```
npm start
```

The project will run in `http://localhost:3000`

## Additional comments
